Hey there! This is my personal page, I'm Alessandro Riva, a first year PhD student at the University of Milano-Bicocca.
My research interests include geometry processing, computer vision and machine learning.
I work in the DigAir research group under the supervision of Prof. Simone Melzi.

Currently I'm working on the use of geometric priors to boost 3D data architectures, with a focus on transformers,
both in the context of point clouds and meshes for tasks such as 

In my free time I enjoy photography and 3D art, passions that also drive my research interests in computer vision and geometry processing.
I also like movies with no plot, old trains and wired architecture.
